# Data-Driven-Simulation-Roads-system-Bangladesh
In this project the roads and bridges in Bangladesh are simulated driven by many datasources on roads and bridges.

The attributes of roads include location (lon, lat), length, quality and traffic activity.

The attributes of bridges include location (lon, lat), length, year of construction and quality.

The 4 assignments in this project lead to a distributed components model, 
where changes in traffic and updates to the roads network are forwarded into the simulation model automatically, and KPI's are constantly updated.

The optimal version of this distributed components model could support investments in specific roads and bridges to maximize traffic without delay.
Moreover, it should be able to predict crucial failures in the system that could be prevented.
